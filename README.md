# Brief overview of the experiment:

It is a behavioral experiment designed to measure attention on the basis of performance i.e. response time and accuracy. 
The task of the experiment is known as a Go/No-Go task, commonly used to measure one's attention towards stimuli in a short time frame.
Individuals have to press a designated key on the keyboard when a target stimulus appears on screen and refrain from pressing if its not a target.

The sequence of the image presentation are as follows:
Ready - Mask - Fixation - Mask - Target - Mask - Fixation - Mask - Target - ...... - Mask - Fixation - Mask - Target - STOP

The mask and fixation images remain on screen for 250 ms, during which time no key presses are registered.
The target images remain on screen for 1000 ms, which is the window for participants to respond by pressing a key.
